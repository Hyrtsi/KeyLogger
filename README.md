# Keylogger

## Introduction

This is the project Keylogger, at some point minimal example of how to read the keyboard and mouse in Windows and playback that later.
Keylogger is a good template for bots and other automatic stuff. For professional use, go and find some other framework.

I made this for purely learning and curiosity purposes to bot rs3 and learn to program stuff that is potentially very useful in the future.
